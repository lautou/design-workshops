Should Red Hat OpenShift AI Self-Managed be deployed in a connected or disconnected environment?

**Issue or Problem**
The environmentâ€™s internet connectivity impacts access to external resources (e.g., container images, updates) and security requirements. A connected environment requires internet access, while a disconnected environment must operate without it. (Aligns with OCP-BASE-07).

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- Connected Environment
- Disconnected Environment

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Connected Environment:** For simplicity in accessing external resources, ideal for rapid deployment.
- **Disconnected Environment:** To ensure security and compliance, critical for sensitive or isolated setups.

**Implications**

- **Connected Environment:** Increases security monitoring needs; enables direct resource pulls (e.g., images, updates), speeding setup.
- **Disconnected Environment:** Demands manual update processes and skilled admins; requires mirroring resources (e.g., images to local registry), adding setup time. (See RHOAI-SM-04).

## RHOAI-SM-04: Mirror registry (disconnected environment)

**Architectural Question**
If deploying in a disconnected environment, what mirror registry will be used for RHOAI components?

**Issue or Problem**
In a disconnected environment (RHOAI-SM-03), a mirror registry is essential for providing OpenShift AI with access to container images and operators. The choice of registry impacts availability, scalability, and integration. (Aligns with OCP-BASE-08).

**Assumption**
OpenShift cluster is in a disconnected environment.

**Alternatives**

- Use OCP Mirror Registry (Filesystem-based or Dedicated)
- Dedicated RHOAI-Specific Mirror (if different from OCP)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Use OCP Mirror Registry:** To leverage the same mirror registry infrastructure used for the underlying OpenShift platform (as decided in OCP-BASE-08), ensuring consistency and simplifying mirror management.
- **Dedicated RHOAI-Specific Mirror:** To maintain a separate mirror registry specifically for RHOAI components, potentially for organizational separation or different update cadences. Generally increases complexity.

**Implications**

- **Use OCP Mirror Registry:** Simplifies overall disconnected setup. Requires ensuring the OCP mirror contains all necessary RHOAI images and catalogs. Update process is unified.
- **Dedicated RHOAI-Specific Mirror:** Increases infrastructure footprint and management overhead. Requires managing two separate mirroring processes and ensuring network connectivity between RHOAI installation sources and its dedicated mirror.

## RHOAI-SM-05: Identity provider Integration

**Architectural Question**
Which OpenShift identity provider (IdP) will be used to authenticate users accessing Red Hat OpenShift AI?

**Issue or Problem**
OpenShift AI relies entirely on the OpenShift platform's configured authentication mechanism (OCP-SEC-03). The choice of IdP affects user login experience, integration with enterprise directories, group management for RBAC, and overall security posture for RHOAI users.

**Assumption**
An appropriate OpenShift IdP must be configured (see OCP-SEC-03).

**Alternatives**

- Leverage Configured OpenShift IdP (HTPasswd, LDAP, OIDC/OAuth)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Leverage Configured OpenShift IdP:** RHOAI integrates directly with the IdP configured at the OpenShift cluster level. The justification aligns with the choice made in OCP-SEC-03 (e.g., simplicity for HTPasswd, enterprise integration for LDAP, modern features/SSO for OIDC).

**Implications**

- The implications are inherited from the OCP-SEC-03 decision. RHOAI dashboard and components utilize the OpenShift OAuth proxy flow, meaning user authentication is handled transparently based on the cluster's IdP configuration. Group synchronization (OCP-SEC-04) becomes important for managing RHOAI roles (RHOAI-SM-06).

## RHOAI-SM-06: User/Group Dashboard Access Configuration

**Architectural Question**
How will access to the OpenShift AI dashboard be controlled based on user groups?

**Issue or Problem**
By default, any authenticated OpenShift user can access the RHOAI dashboard. A mechanism is needed to restrict access to specific administrator and standard user groups defined in OpenShift, aligning with RBAC best practices.

**Assumption**
Access to the OpenShift AI dashboard must be restricted based on OpenShift user groups. OpenShift groups are synchronized or defined (OCP-SEC-04). RHOAI IdP integration is confirmed (RHOAI-SM-05).

**Alternatives**

- Configure Access via `Auth` Resource (Recommended)
- Use Default Unrestricted Access (Not Recommended for Production)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Configure Access via `Auth` Resource:** To manage RHOAI dashboard administrator and standard user access by defining the corresponding OpenShift group names in the dedicated `Auth` custom resource (`dscinitialization_odscustomizations_console_auth`). This is the standard, supported method.
- **Use Default Unrestricted Access:** To allow any authenticated OpenShift user to access the OpenShift AI dashboard without explicit group membership checks. Simplifies initial setup but lacks role separation.

**Implications**

- **Configure Access via `Auth` Resource:** Requires identifying or creating appropriate OpenShift groups (e.g., `rhods-admins`, `rhods-users`) and configuring the `Auth` resource (typically via GitOps overlay) to reference them. Enforces role separation (admins see admin settings, users see user view). Requires group sync or manual group management in OpenShift.
- **Use Default Unrestricted Access:** Simplest setup, no group configuration needed. Provides limited security segmentation; all authenticated users can log in, potentially seeing inappropriate options or consuming resources without oversight. Not suitable for multi-tenant or production environments.

## RHOAI-SM-07: OpenShift AI Namespace Strategy (Core Components)

**Architectural Question**
What namespace strategy will be used for deploying OpenShift AI core components?

**Issue or Problem**
Red Hat OpenShift AI Self-Managed uses default projects (`redhat-ods-operator`, `redhat-ods-applications`), but enterprise environments often require custom names for standardization or compliance. This decision focuses on the core platform namespaces, distinct from user workload namespaces (RHOAI-SM-13).

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- Use Default RHOAI Namespaces (Core Components)
- Configure Custom Namespaces for RHOAI Core Components

**Decision**
#TODO: Document the decision for each cluster.#

**Justification**

- **Use Default RHOAI Namespaces:** To simplify installation and maintenance by accepting the standard naming (`redhat-ods-*`). Aligns directly with documentation and default operator behavior.
- **Configure Custom Namespaces for RHOAI Core:** To adhere to strict organizational naming conventions by specifying custom project names for the core RHOAI operator and application components during installation via the `DataScienceCluster` CR.

**Implications**

- **Use Default Namespaces:** Easiest setup. May not meet strict naming policies.
- **Configure Custom Core Namespaces:** Requires defining custom names via `DataScienceCluster` CR _before_ initial installation. Ensures compliance with naming standards for platform components but adds configuration steps. Does not affect the default `rhods-notebooks` namespace unless also customized.

## RHOAI-SM-08: CA Certificate management

**Architectural Question**
Which CA certificate bundle will be used for Red Hat OpenShift AI components, and how will its lifecycle be managed?

**Issue or Problem**
OpenShift AI components require trusted CA certificates for secure TLS communication (internal and external). Choosing the bundle and manager affects trust scope, integration effort, and operational consistency.

**Assumption**
Secure communication using TLS is required.

**Alternatives**

- Managed by RHOAI Operator (Legacy/Compatibility Mode)
- Externally Managed (`managementState: Removed`, Recommended)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Managed by RHOAI Operator:** To have the OpenShift AI Operator automatically manage a `trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap. Simpler initial setup but less control and potentially conflicts with cluster-wide trust.
- **Externally Managed (`managementState: Removed`):** Recommended approach (RHOAI 2.25+). The operator does not manage the CA bundle. Trust is handled externally (e.g., via cluster-wide proxy settings, injected CAs via ConfigMaps referenced by workloads, service mesh trust). Offers better security separation and aligns with standard cluster practices.

**Implications**

- **Managed by RHOAI Operator:** Operator manages `trusted-ca-bundle` ConfigMap. Provides automatic trust injection for managed components but increases operator scope and potential conflicts.
- **Externally Managed/Removed:** Requires administrators to ensure necessary CAs are trusted via other mechanisms (cluster proxy, manual ConfigMaps, service mesh). More initial effort but clearer separation of concerns, less operator complexity. Preferred long-term.

## RHOAI-SM-09: S3 Object Storage Location

**Architectural Question**
Will S3-compatible object storage be used for OpenShift AI, and if so, where will it be hosted?

**Issue or Problem**
OpenShift AI requires S3-compatible object storage for model serving artifacts (KServe) and Data Science Pipelines intermediate data. The choice of provider impacts integration, cost, latency, and management.

**Assumption**
Model serving (RHOAI-SM-27) and/or Data Science Pipelines (RHOAI-SM-33) capabilities are required.

**Alternatives**

- OpenShift Data Foundation (MCG) On-Cluster
- External Cloud Provider S3 Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob, GCP)
- External Dedicated S3 Storage (e.g., MinIO, Ceph RGW On-Prem)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **OpenShift Data Foundation (MCG):** To utilize integrated, on-cluster object storage provided by ODF (if deployed, OCP-STOR-01 / ODF-BASE-02), optimizing data co-location and simplifying platform storage management.
- **External Cloud Provider S3:** To leverage native cloud services for scalability, durability, and managed features (less relevant for on-prem context unless hybrid connectivity exists).
- **External Dedicated S3:** To utilize an existing, dedicated, enterprise-grade S3 solution (on-prem or private cloud) for centralized storage management outside the OCP cluster lifecycle.

**Implications**

- **OpenShift Data Foundation (MCG):** Requires ODF installation/configuration. Ensures low-latency access within cluster. Requires sizing ODF appropriately. Adds MCG resource overhead.
- **External Cloud Provider S3:** Requires external connectivity and secure credential management. Offloads S3 management. Cost based on provider.
- **External Dedicated S3:** Requires configuring external connectivity and secure credentials. Performance depends on network. Offloads S3 management to separate team/system.

## RHOAI-SM-10: Default storage class for Red Hat OpenShift AI components

**Architectural Question**
Which default storage class (StorageClass) will be configured for use by Red Hat OpenShift AI components requiring dynamic Persistent Volume provisioning?

**Issue or Problem**
Components like workbenches automatically create PVCs and rely on a cluster-defined default `StorageClass`. The selected default affects performance, access modes (RWO/RWX), and capacity management for these components.

**Assumption**
Dynamic volume provisioning is used. Components like Workbenches (RHOAI-SM-14) will require PVCs.

**Alternatives**

- Use Existing Cluster Default StorageClass
- Designate a Specific RHOAI Default StorageClass

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Use Existing Cluster Default:** Simplest approach, leveraging the pre-configured default `StorageClass` if it meets RHOAI's needs (e.g., provides reliable RWO block storage).
- **Designate a Specific RHOAI Default:** Explicitly choose/create a `StorageClass` (e.g., from ODF, OCP-STOR-01 / ODF-BASE-01) and mark it as default (`storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"`), ensuring RHOAI components use the desired backend. Requires cluster-admin privilege.

**Implications**

- **Use Existing Cluster Default:** RHOAI storage characteristics depend entirely on the cluster default. May not be optimal (e.g., slow performance). Easiest initial setup.
- **Designate Specific RHOAI Default:** Ensures RHOAI components (like workbench PVCs) use intended storage (e.g., ODF `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd`). Requires administrative action to set default. **Important:** Changing the default affects _all_ workloads cluster-wide that don't specify an explicit `storageClassName`.

## RHOAI-SM-11: Usage data collection (Telemetry)

**Architectural Question**
Will you enable usage data collection (telemetry) for Red Hat OpenShift AI?

**Issue or Problem**
OpenShift AI Self-Managed can optionally send anonymized usage data to Red Hat to help improve the product. Enabling this affects privacy considerations, connectivity requirements (if connected), and compliance policies.

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- Enable Sending Usage Data to Red Hat
- Disable Sending Usage Data to Red Hat

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Sending Usage Data:** To contribute usage statistics that help Red Hat understand product usage patterns and prioritize improvements. May facilitate proactive support.
- **Disable Sending Usage Data:** To maintain strict data isolation, comply with privacy regulations, or operate in disconnected environments (RHOAI-SM-03).

**Implications**

- **Enable Sending Usage Data:** Requires outbound internet connectivity (if cluster is connected) to Red Hat's telemetry endpoints. Data is typically anonymized configuration and usage metrics. May require security/privacy review.
- **Disable Sending Usage Data:** Ensures no data leaves the cluster for telemetry. Requires explicitly setting `spec.telemetry.enabled: false` in the `DataScienceCluster` CR. Necessary for disconnected environments.

**(Start of User Environment Section)**

## RHOAI-SM-13: Data science project allocation strategy (User Namespaces)

**Architectural Question**
How will OpenShift Projects (Kubernetes Namespaces) be allocated and used for data science activities (workbenches, pipelines, models)?

**Issue or Problem**
OpenShift Projects provide isolation (resources, RBAC, network, quotas). The allocation strategy impacts multi-tenancy, resource management, security, and collaboration. (Aligns with OCP-MGT-01).

**Assumption**
Data science workloads need namespace isolation beyond the core RHOAI components (RHOAI-SM-07).

**Alternatives**

- Single Shared Data Science Project (e.g., default `rhods-notebooks`)
- Project per Team/Group
- Project per ML Project/Initiative
- Hybrid (e.g., Shared for experimentation, dedicated for production)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Single Shared Project:** Simplest, often uses default `rhods-notebooks`. Users share resources/RBAC. Suitable for small teams/pilots.
- **Project per Team/Group:** Isolation between DS teams. Allows team-specific RBAC, quotas, network policies. Promotes autonomy.
- **Project per ML Project/Initiative:** Highest isolation (per model/problem). Facilitates project-specific resource tracking/security.
- **Hybrid:** Shared space for experimentation, dedicated/controlled namespaces for critical pipelines/serving.

**Implications**

- **Single Shared:** Higher risk of resource contention (needs quotas, OCP-MGT-04). Complex internal RBAC/NetworkPolicy. Hard to track usage per initiative.
- **Project per Team:** Increases namespace count. Requires automation for project creation/config. Clearer resource/security boundaries per team.
- **Project per ML Project:** Largest number of namespaces, needs high automation. Granular control/chargeback.
- **Hybrid:** Balances flexibility/control but needs clear promotion processes between shared/dedicated namespaces.

- Red Hat Provided ROCm Images (if AMD GPUs enabled, RHOAI-SM-25)
- Red Hat Provided Intel Images (if Intel accelerators enabled, RHOAI-SM-24 / RHOAI-SM-26)
- Open Data Hub (ODH) Community Images
- Custom-Built Images (Derived from Red Hat/ODH)
- Combination of Above

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Red Hat Provided Standard/CUDA/ROCm/Intel Images:** Use officially supported, certified images ensuring compatibility. Accelerator-specific images are necessary for GPU/HPU workloads.
- **ODH Community Images:** Leverage wider variety from upstream ODH (community support).
- **Custom-Built Images:** Create tailored environments with specific libraries/drivers/tools pre-installed for consistency/project needs.
- **Combination:** Offer a mix (supported base + custom) for flexibility.

**Implications**

- **Red Hat Provided:** Limited customization (users install packages at runtime). Updates managed via RHOAI upgrades. Consistent, supported baseline.
- **ODH Community:** More options but no official Red Hat support. Requires vetting. Community-dependent updates.
- **Custom-Built:** Max control/standardization. Requires build pipeline (Pipelines, Jenkins, etc.), dependency management, security scanning, updates. Increases maintenance. (See RHOAI-SM-15, RHOAI-SM-16).
- **Combination:** Flexibility but needs governance on support/management of custom images.

**Assumption**
Custom notebook images will be built (Decision from RHOAI-SM-14).

**Alternatives**

- Minimal Common Set (e.g., visualization, data manipulation extensions)
- Domain-Specific Sets (e.g., NLP, CV, Time Series)
- Framework-Specific Sets (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost variants)
- Comprehensive Custom Set (Mixing multiple domains/frameworks)
- Allow Runtime Installation Only (No custom packages baked-in)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Minimal Common Set:** Provide generally useful tools with minimal bloat.
- **Domain/Framework-Specific Sets:** Create optimized, tailored images, reducing size/conflicts.
- **Comprehensive Custom Set:** Build 'kitchen-sink' image for convenience, potentially large/complex.
- **Runtime Installation Only:** Simplest custom image (base only), users install via pip/conda in workbench.

**Implications**

- **Baking Packages:** Ensures consistency/reproducibility. Reduces user startup time. Requires managing dependencies, rebuilding images for updates. Increases image size. Security scanning critical.
- **Domain/Framework-Specific:** Multiple images to manage, but tailored/smaller environments.
- **Runtime Installation Only:** Smallest images. Max user flexibility but risks inconsistencies. Users need internet/mirrors for install. Increases workbench setup time.

**Assumption**
Custom notebook images will be built (Decision from RHOAI-SM-14).

**Alternatives**

- Existing HA Corporate Registry (e.g., Quay, Artifactory, Nexus)
- OpenShift Internal Registry (Image Registry Operator)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Existing HA Corporate Registry:** Leverage existing enterprise registry for central storage, governance (scanning, signing), availability, scalability. Aligns with existing practices.
- **OpenShift Internal Registry:** Store images within the cluster. Simplifies network access (no external pulls), optimizes pull times, reduces external dependencies.

**Implications**

- **Existing HA Corporate Registry:** Requires network connectivity. Pull secrets needed in workbench namespaces. Build pipelines need push access. Integrates with existing security scanning/signing.
- **OpenShift Internal Registry:** Requires configuring internal registry with persistent storage (ODF RWO/RWX or other PVs, OCP-STOR-01). Lifecycle tied to cluster. Build pipelines within cluster can easily push. May need separate security scanning setup.

## RHOAI-SM-17: Workbenches provisioning strategy

**Architectural Question**
How will workbenches (JupyterLab or other IDE environments) be provisioned and managed for data scientists?

**Issue or Problem**
Workbenches are the primary IDE. The provisioning strategy impacts resource allocation (CPU, memory, PVCs, GPUs), user experience, environment consistency, and cost.

**Assumption**
N/A

**Alternatives**

- Individual Workbench per User (Self-Service)
- Shared Team Workbenches
- Role/Task-Specific Workbench Configurations (e.g., GPU vs. CPU)

**Decision**

**Issue or Problem**
RHOAI allows enabling `code-server` as an alternative IDE, offering a VS Code experience. However, it's often Tech Preview, may lack full integration (e.g., Elyra, RHOAI-SM-34), and uses a different base image.

**Assumption**
Red Hat notebook server images (RHOAI-SM-14) are used. Workbenches are provisioned (RHOAI-SM-17).

**Alternatives**

- Enable Code-Server Workbench Option
- Disable Code-Server Workbench Option (JupyterLab Only)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Code-Server:** Provide VS Code users an alternative IDE, potentially better for extensive scripting or specific extensions.
- **Disable Code-Server:** Standardize on JupyterLab, ensuring full feature compatibility (Elyra) and simplifying available image options.

**Implications**

- **Enable Code-Server:** Makes `code-server` image available. Users get VS Code but may lose Jupyter-specific integrations (Elyra). Often requires enabling Tech Preview features in `DataScienceCluster` CR.
- **Disable Code-Server:** Simplifies user choice, ensures all users get fully integrated JupyterLab. Reduces number of base images to manage/customize.

**Issue or Problem**
Workbench PVC size impacts local data storage capacity and overall cluster storage consumption.

**Assumption**
Workbenches are configured (RHOAI-SM-17). Local PVC storage is used (RHOAI-SM-20).

**Alternatives**

- Fixed Default Size for All Workbenches
- User-Selectable Size (within pre-defined limits/tiers)
- Custom Size per Workbench (Admin controlled)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Fixed Default Size:** Simplest administration. Consistent starting point (e.g., 20Gi).
- **User-Selectable Size:** Flexibility for users to choose based on needs (e.g., Small-20Gi, Medium-50Gi, Large-100Gi).
- **Custom Size:** Most flexible but requires manual intervention/automation by admins.

**Implications**

- **Fixed Default:** May be insufficient for large local datasets/libraries. Users might hit limits. Easiest capacity planning.
- **User-Selectable:** Balances flexibility/control. Needs defined tiers and potentially project quotas (OCP-MGT-04). Users need guidance.
- **Custom:** High admin overhead unless automated. Precise allocation but complicates capacity management.

**Architectural Question**
Will the Data Science Pipelines component (based on Kubeflow Pipelines with Tekton backend) be enabled within RHOAI?

**Issue or Problem**
Enabling Data Science Pipelines provides a framework for orchestrating multi-step ML workflows. It requires specific configuration (database, object storage) and impacts the tools available to MLOps engineers. (Related to PIPELINES-01 for broader CI/CD strategy).

**Assumption**
Orchestration of ML workflows is required.

**Alternatives**

- Enable Data Science Pipelines Component
- Disable Data Science Pipelines Component (Rely on OpenShift Pipelines/Tekton or external orchestrators)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Data Science Pipelines:** To provide an integrated, UI-driven (via RHOAI dashboard and Elyra) and SDK-driven platform specifically designed for defining, running, and managing ML pipelines within OpenShift AI. Uses Kubeflow Pipelines API standard with Tekton execution.
- **Disable Data Science Pipelines:** To simplify the RHOAI deployment if ML pipeline orchestration is handled by other tools (e.g., standard OpenShift Pipelines/Tekton for simpler CI/CD-like tasks, external orchestrators like Airflow, or if not required initially).

**Implications**

- **Enable Data Science Pipelines:** Installs KFP/Tekton components. Requires configuring a database backend (RHOAI-SM-29) and S3 object storage (RHOAI-SM-09). Enables Elyra usage (RHOAI-SM-28). Consumes additional cluster resources. Provides ML-specific pipeline features (artifact tracking, metadata).
- **Disable Data Science Pipelines:** Reduces RHOAI footprint and dependencies. Users needing pipeline orchestration must use alternative tools. Elyra extension in JupyterLab will not function for pipeline submission.

Elyra provides a UI within JupyterLab for building KFP/Tekton pipelines visually. Enabling it requires compatible notebook images and impacts user workflow.

**Assumption**
Data Science Pipelines component is enabled (RHOAI-SM-27). Users primarily use JupyterLab (RHOAI-SM-17/RHOAI-SM-18).

**Alternatives**

- Enable and Promote Elyra Usage
- Disable or Do Not Promote Elyra (Use KFP SDK Primarily)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Elyra:** Provide intuitive visual tool for pipeline construction in Jupyter, lowering barrier to entry.
- **Disable Elyra:** Standardize on programmatic pipeline definition using KFP SDK directly in code. Offers more flexibility/control for complex pipelines but needs more coding expertise.

**Implications**

- **Enable Elyra:** Requires notebook images including Elyra (most standard RHOAI images do, RHOAI-SM-14). Simplifies pipeline creation. Generated pipeline is KFP/Tekton compatible. Some advanced KFP features might not be exposed via UI.
- **Disable Elyra:** Users define pipelines entirely via KFP SDK (Python). Requires SDK in notebook images. Provides full access to all KFP features but steeper learning curve.

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Internal MariaDB:** Simplicity/ease of setup. RHOAI auto-deploys MariaDB within cluster. Suitable for non-prod or smaller scale.
- **External MySQL/MariaDB:** Production environments needing higher scalability, reliability, integration with existing DB backup/management. Leverages external, potentially HA database.

**Implications**

- **Internal MariaDB:** Simplest deployment. Runs as pods, consumes cluster resources. Data on PVC; persistence/backup depend on cluster storage/backup strategy (RHOAI-SM-40). May not scale for very high throughput.
- **External MySQL/MariaDB:** Requires provisioning/managing separate DB instance. RHOAI Pipelines need connection details config. Offloads DB management but adds external dependency. Allows leveraging enterprise DB features (HA, backup, monitoring).

## RHOAI-SM-30: Distributed workloads enablement (Ray/CodeFlare)

**Architectural Question**
Will the capability for distributed AI/ML workloads using Ray (via CodeFlare/KubeRay) be enabled?

**Issue or Problem**
RHOAI includes operators for temporary Ray clusters (distributed data processing/training). Enabling impacts cluster resources, dependencies, complexity.

**Assumption**
Workloads might benefit from distributed computation.

**Alternatives**

- Enable Distributed Workloads (CodeFlare/KubeRay)
- Disable Distributed Workloads

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Distributed Workloads:** Allow data scientists to scale computationally intensive tasks (large data preprocessing, distributed training) across multiple nodes using Ray framework.
- **Disable Distributed Workloads:** Simplicity/resource conservation if workloads don't require distributed compute beyond single-node (multi-core/GPU).

**Implications**

- **Enable Distributed Workloads:** Installs CodeFlare/KubeRay operators. Requires additional cluster resources (~1.6 vCPU, ~2 GiB RAM for operators minimum). Users define/launch Ray clusters (`AppWrapper` or `RayCluster` CRs). Requires configuring security (Ray dashboard certs). Adds complexity but enables performance gains for suitable workloads. Enables RHOAI-SM-31, RHOAI-SM-32, RHOAI-SM-33.
- **Disable Distributed Workloads:** Reduces operators/resources consumed by RHOAI. Simplifies platform but limits ability to scale certain tasks horizontally.

## RHOAI-SM-31: Quota management for distributed workloads (Kueue)

**Architectural Question**
How will resource quotas and scheduling for distributed workloads (Ray clusters via CodeFlare) be managed?

**Issue or Problem**
Distributed workloads (Ray clusters) consume significant resources. RHOAI integrates Kueue for batch scheduling/resource quota management specifically for these, preventing cluster saturation. Configuration impacts resource sharing/prioritization.

**Assumption**
Distributed workloads (CodeFlare/KubeRay) are enabled (RHOAI-SM-30).

**Alternatives**

- Enable Kueue Integration (Recommended)
- Disable Kueue Integration (Rely on OpenShift Quotas only)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Kueue:** Leverage Kueue's batch scheduling (fair sharing, prioritization) and resource quotas (`ClusterQueue`, `LocalQueue`) designed for managing ephemeral, high-resource jobs like Ray clusters. Finer control than standard OpenShift quotas.
- **Disable Kueue:** Rely solely on standard OpenShift ResourceQuotas at namespace level (OCP-MGT-04). Simpler setup but lacks advanced scheduling features.

**Implications**

- **Enable Kueue:** Installs Kueue operator. Requires configuring `ClusterQueue` (overall resources) and potentially `LocalQueue`s (user namespace subdivision). Adds scheduling overhead but better control over resource-intensive batch jobs.
- **Disable Kueue:** Simplifies installation. Ray cluster consumption limited only by standard OCP quotas, risking resource exhaustion/unfair distribution with concurrent large jobs. Lacks queuing/prioritization.

## RHOAI-SM-32: Authentication Method for Ray Dashboard

**Architectural Question**
Which authentication method will be used to secure access to the Ray Dashboard associated with distributed Ray clusters?

**Issue or Problem**
The Ray Dashboard needs protection. RHOAI supports integrating it with OpenShift OAuth (SSO) or alternative methods.

**Assumption**
Distributed workloads (CodeFlare/KubeRay) are enabled (RHOAI-SM-30).

**Alternatives**

- OpenShift OAuth Integration (Default/Recommended)
- Custom/No Integrated Authentication

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **OpenShift OAuth:** Leverage cluster's existing authentication for seamless/secure access based on OpenShift user/RBAC. Simplifies user management.
- **Custom/No Auth:** Use alternative methods (Ray's own, or unprotected in trusted envs). Flexible but potentially less secure or more config effort.

**Implications**

- **OpenShift OAuth:** Requires configuring OCP OAuth details in Ray cluster definition (often handled by CodeFlare defaults). Access controlled via OCP login/roles. May need cert handling for custom cluster CAs.
- **Custom/No Auth:** Bypasses OCP login for dashboard. Requires manual Ray security config or accepts lower security. Simpler in isolated test envs, not recommended for prod.

## RHOAI-SM-33: Distributed workloads monitoring (Ray)

**Architectural Question**
Will monitoring be enabled for distributed workloads (Ray clusters)?

**Issue or Problem**
Monitoring Ray clusters provides visibility (resource usage, job status) but requires enabling OpenShift User Workload Monitoring (UWM) and ensuring Ray metrics are scraped, impacting resources/configuration. (Aligns with OCP-MON-01).

**Assumption**
Distributed workloads (CodeFlare/KubeRay) are enabled (RHOAI-SM-30).

**Alternatives**

- Enable Ray Monitoring via UWM
- Disable Ray Monitoring

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable Ray Monitoring:** Collect metrics from Ray clusters (resource utilization, task status), integrate into OpenShift Monitoring (Grafana) for observability. Essential for performance/troubleshooting.
- **Disable Ray Monitoring:** Simpler deployment, reduced resource use if detailed Ray metrics aren't needed (rely on basic pod metrics, logs, Ray Dashboard).

**Implications**

- **Enable Ray Monitoring:** Requires enabling User Workload Monitoring (UWM) in cluster (OCP-MON-01). Consumes Prometheus resources for scraping/storing Ray metrics. Ray cluster defs need annotations/labels for scraping. Provides valuable operational insights.
- **Disable Ray Monitoring:** Reduces monitoring overhead/resource use. Limits visibility into Ray cluster internal state/performance, making troubleshooting harder.

**(Start of Model Serving Section)**

## RHOAI-SM-34: Model Serving Platform Selection

**Architectural Question**
Which model serving platform architecture will be used in Red Hat OpenShift AI?

**Issue or Problem**
A decision is needed on the technology for deploying models as scalable endpoints, affecting dependencies, resources, complexity, and features (e.g., scale-to-zero).

**Assumption**
Model deployment capabilities are required.

**Alternatives**

- KServe (Single Model Serving / RawDeployment Mode)
- Custom Application Deployment (OpenShift Deployments)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **KServe (RawDeployment Mode):** Deploy each model as a separate, scalable endpoint optimized for AI/ML using integrated KServe. Leverages standardized inference protocols, model management, observability. RawDeployment avoids reliance on OpenShift Serverless.
- **Custom Application Deployment:** Use standard OpenShift methods (`Deployment`, `Service`) for model endpoints, wrapping model in custom container. Max control over Kubernetes primitives but requires building more infrastructure manually.

**Implications**

- **KServe (RawDeployment Mode):** Requires KServe components (Operator, Controller). Relies on Istio Service Mesh for advanced traffic management. Provides standardized MLOps workflow but abstracts some K8s details. RawDeployment ensures compatibility/avoids deprecated Serverless dependencies.
- **Custom Application Deployment:** Requires developers to build container images with serving logic (Flask/FastAPI) and manually create K8s resources (`Deployment`, `Service`, `Route`, `HPA`). Lacks specialized KServe features (standardized metrics, easy canary) unless implemented manually.

## RHOAI-SM-35: Authorization provider for KServe Model Serving

**Architectural Question**
Will an authorization provider (Authorino) be used for KServe single-model serving endpoints?

**Issue or Problem**
KServe endpoints may need fine-grained authorization beyond basic OpenShift RBAC. Using Authorino (integrated with Istio) impacts security granularity and complexity. Skipping it relies on simpler OpenShift/Istio mechanisms.

**Assumption**
Single-model serving platform (KServe) is enabled (RHOAI-SM-34).

**Alternatives**

- Use Authorino for KServe Authorization
- Do Not Use Authorino (Rely on OpenShift RBAC/Istio Policy)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Use Authorino:** Enable dynamic, policy-based, fine-grained authorization (OIDC tokens, API keys, JWT claims) for accessing served models, enhancing endpoint security.
- **Do Not Use Authorino:** Simpler authorization management, relying on native OpenShift RBAC and standard Istio authorization policies for basic access control.

**Implications**

- **Use Authorino:** Requires Authorino Operator installation/configuration. Needs expertise in Authorino `AuthConfig` policies and Istio integration. Increases complexity but provides robust, flexible authorization.
- **Do Not Use Authorino:** Reduces admin overhead/dependencies. Authorization relies on standard K8s/Istio mechanisms, possibly offering less granularity.

## RHOAI-SM-36: Model-serving runtime for KServe

**Architectural Question**
Which specific model serving runtime(s) will be primarily used within the KServe single-model serving platform?

**Issue or Problem**
KServe supports various runtimes for different model formats and optimizations (LLMs, ONNX, scikit-learn). Selecting runtimes determines which models can be served and how efficiently.

**Assumption**
Single-model serving platform (KServe) is enabled (RHOAI-SM-34).

**Alternatives**

- RHOAI Custom Runtimes (Caikit+TGIS based, default for LLMs)
- KServe Core Runtimes (e.g., SKLearnServer, XGBoostServer, PMMLServer)
- vLLM Runtime (via KServe Custom Runtime - for high-throughput LLM inference)
- OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS) Runtime (via KServe Custom Runtime - optimized for Intel)
- NVIDIA Triton Inference Server (via KServe Custom Runtime - GPU-focused, multi-format)
- Custom-Built Runtimes

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **RHOAI Custom (Caikit+TGIS):** Use default RHOAI runtime, optimized for LLMs with Caikit framework/TGIS.
- **KServe Core:** Leverage standard runtimes for common formats (scikit-learn, XGBoost, PMML).
- **vLLM:** Achieve high throughput/low latency LLM inference via specialized vLLM engine (custom runtime).
- **OVMS:** Optimize inference performance, particularly on Intel hardware (CPU, GPU, VPU) (custom runtime).
- **Triton:** Use NVIDIA's flexible inference server (multiple frameworks, NVIDIA GPU optimized) (custom runtime).
- **Custom-Built:** Support niche formats or bespoke logic by building custom KServe runtime container.

**Implications**

- **RHOAI/KServe Core:** Easier management (often included/documented). May not offer peak performance for all types/hardware.
- **vLLM/OVMS/Triton (Custom):** Higher performance for specialized domains (LLMs, Intel, NVIDIA GPUs). Requires deploying/managing custom `ServingRuntime`/`ClusterServingRuntime`. May need specific hardware (GPUs for vLLM/Triton). Compatibility must be maintained.
- **Custom-Built:** Max flexibility but requires significant development/maintenance for runtime container/KServe integration.

## RHOAI-SM-37: NVIDIA NIM Serving Platform Integration

**Architectural Question**
Will NVIDIA NIM integration be enabled for the single-model serving platform in Red Hat OpenShift AI?

**Issue or Problem**
NVIDIA NIM provides optimized inference microservices for LLMs. Enabling it impacts integration complexity and hardware dependency.

**Assumption**
NVIDIA GPU acceleration is enabled (RHOAI-SM-23). Single-model serving (KServe) is enabled (RHOAI-SM-34).

**Alternatives**

- Enable NVIDIA NIM Integration
- Rely on Standard KServe Runtime Environment (e.g., vLLM, Triton, Caikit)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable NVIDIA NIM:** Leverage NVIDIA's optimized microservices for deploying high-performance LLMs, maximizing GPU utilization for inference.
- **Rely on Standard KServe:** Use generic KServe model servers without specialized NVIDIA inference components.

**Implications**

- **Enable NVIDIA NIM:** Requires specific hardware/software configs validated by NVIDIA/Red Hat. Requires access to NIM images (NGC). Increases complexity (integrating specialized proprietary software). Requires deploying NIM as custom KServe runtime. May involve NVIDIA AI Enterprise licensing (RHOAI-SM-12).
- **Rely on Standard KServe:** Less specialized integration. Performance optimization relies on chosen model server (vLLM, Triton, Caikit) and GPU Operator config (NVIDIA-GPU-XX ADs).

## RHOAI-SM-38: Distributed Inference with LLM-D [TECH-PREVIEW]

**Architectural Question**
Will the Distributed Inference with llm-d component [TECH-PREVIEW] be used for large language model serving?

**Issue or Problem**
Serving LLMs often requires significant resources and sharding workloads across multiple nodes/GPUs, which is complex for scaling/recovery. `llm-d` aims to simplify this.

**Assumption**
LLMs requiring distributed processing (multi-GPU/multi-node) are planned for deployment via KServe (RHOAI-SM-34).

**Alternatives**

- Enable Distributed Inference with llm-d [TECH-PREVIEW]
- Rely on Standard KServe (Single-Instance or basic scaling) Deployment

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable llm-d:** Simplify complex LLM deployments by providing capabilities for sharding workloads across multiple nodes/GPUs using this specialized framework.
- **Rely on Standard KServe:** Use default serving mechanism where model runs within single KServe instance (can use multi-GPU on one node). Suitable for models not requiring multi-node sharding.

**Implications**

- **Enable llm-d:** **Technology Preview** feature, not supported under production SLAs. Requires specific configuration in KServe `InferenceService` to use `llm-d` runtime. Adds complexity specific to this preview feature.
- **Rely on Standard KServe:** Limits size/requirements of models efficiently served from single KServe endpoint (though KServe scales replicas horizontally). Doesn't natively handle model sharding across instances.

**(Start of Monitoring & Lifecycle Section)**

## RHOAI-SM-39: Single-model serving platform (KServe) monitoring enablement

**Architectural Question**
Will monitoring be enabled for the KServe single-model serving platform?

**Issue or Problem**
Monitoring KServe `InferenceService` deployments provides visibility into request latency, throughput, success/error rates, and resource usage. Enabling it requires User Workload Monitoring (UWM). (Aligns with OCP-MON-01).

**Assumption**
Single-model serving platform (KServe) is enabled (RHOAI-SM-34).

**Alternatives**

- Enable KServe Monitoring via UWM
- Disable KServe Monitoring

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable KServe Monitoring:** Collect metrics from served models, integrate into OpenShift Monitoring (Grafana). Crucial for understanding serving performance, identifying bottlenecks, setting alerts.
- **Disable KServe Monitoring:** Simpler deployment, reduced resource use if detailed serving metrics aren't required (rely on basic pod metrics/logs).

**Implications**

- **Enable KServe Monitoring:** Requires enabling User Workload Monitoring (UWM) in cluster (OCP-MON-01). Consumes Prometheus resources for scraping/storing KServe metrics. Provides essential MLOps observability. RHOAI typically configures KServe scraping automatically if UWM enabled.
- **Disable KServe Monitoring:** Reduces monitoring overhead. Limits visibility into model serving performance, making diagnosis/optimization harder.

## RHOAI-SM-40: NVIDIA NIM Metrics collection

**Architectural Question**
If using NVIDIA NIM, will metrics collection be enabled for NIM-based KServe deployments?

**Issue or Problem**
Monitoring NIM-specific metrics (GPU utilization, inference latency) enhances visibility but requires ensuring NIM endpoints are scraped by OpenShift Monitoring (UWM).

**Assumption**
NVIDIA NIM integration is enabled (RHOAI-SM-37). User Workload Monitoring (UWM) is enabled (OCP-MON-01 / RHOAI-SM-39).

**Alternatives**

- Enable NIM Metrics Collection
- Disable NIM Metrics Collection

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable NIM Metrics:** Detailed visibility into performance/resource consumption of NIM inference servers for troubleshooting/optimization.
- **Disable NIM Metrics:** Reduce monitoring overhead if standard KServe/pod metrics suffice.

**Implications**

- **Enable NIM Metrics:** Requires configuring `ServiceMonitor`/`PodMonitor` to target NIM metrics endpoint within KServe `InferenceService`. May need custom annotations. Consumes Prometheus resources.
- **Disable NIM Metrics:** Simplifies monitoring config but limits insight into NIM runtime behavior. Relies on higher-level KServe metrics.

## RHOAI-SM-41: TrustyAI Monitoring for Data Science Models

**Architectural Question**
Will the TrustyAI component be enabled for monitoring model fairness and explainability?

**Issue or Problem**
TrustyAI provides advanced monitoring (fairness metrics, explainability) beyond basic serving metrics. Enabling it requires deploying the TrustyAI service and integrating it with model serving runtimes.

**Assumption**
Model serving (likely KServe, RHOAI-SM-34) is enabled.

**Alternatives**

- Enable TrustyAI Service
- Disable TrustyAI Service

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **Enable TrustyAI:** Gain insights into model fairness, identify bias, generate explanations for predictions, supporting responsible AI/compliance.
- **Disable TrustyAI:** Simpler deployment if advanced fairness/explainability monitoring aren't immediate needs (rely on standard performance metrics, RHOAI-SM-39).

**Implications**

- **Enable TrustyAI:** Requires enabling `trustyai` component in `DataScienceCluster` CR. Deploys TrustyAI operator/service pods (consumes resources). `InferenceService`s need configuration (annotations) to send prediction data to TrustyAI. Requires expertise in configuring fairness metrics/interpreting explanations.
- **Disable TrustyAI:** Reduces resource use/config complexity. Limits observability to standard operational metrics, lacking insights into bias/rationale.

## RHOAI-SM-42: Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) Backup Strategy for RHOAI

**Architectural Question**
Will backup be implemented for Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) used specifically by Red Hat OpenShift AI components (e.g., workbenches, pipeline metadata DB if internal)?

**Issue or Problem**
A defined backup strategy is needed for data recoverability/compliance for critical artifacts stored in RHOAI-related PVCs. (Aligns with OCP-MGT-05 for general platform backup).

**Assumption**
RHOAI components utilize PVCs (e.g., Workbenches RHOAI-SM-17/RHOAI-SM-19, Internal Pipeline DB RHOAI-SM-29). Data persistence/recovery is required.

**Alternatives**

- OADP Operator using CSI Snapshots/Kopia (Leveraging Platform Strategy)
- No Dedicated Backup Solution for RHOAI PVCs (Rely on user actions like Git or underlying storage snapshots only)

**Decision**
#TODO#

**Justification**

- **OADP Operator:** Leverage official OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) for application-consistent backup of RHOAI PVCs (using volume snapshots for CSI storage like ODF, or file backups via Kopia). Integrates with platform backup strategy (OCP-MGT-05). Recommended for comprehensive protection.
- **No Dedicated Backup:** Rely on underlying storage snapshots (application-unaware) or manual user actions (Git push, RHOAI-SM-20). Accepts risk of non-integrated backup/recovery.

**Implications**

- **OADP Operator:** Requires OADP configured (as per OCP-MGT-05) with backup storage location (S3). Ensures application-aware backup/restore integrated with K8s resources. Adds management overhead for schedules/restores.
- **No Dedicated Backup:** Recovery relies on external storage mechanisms or manual intervention. High risk of data loss/complex recovery for data solely on PVCs. Violates enterprise data protection best practices.
