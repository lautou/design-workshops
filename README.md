# **AI-Powered Presentation Generation Pipeline**

This project provides a powerful, fully automated pipeline to generate branded Google Slides presentations from a collection of source documents. It uses Gemini via the Vertex AI API to act as a technical content curator, generating a structured JSON representation of the slide deck, including references to relevant images within your documents.

The pipeline is designed to be robust and flexible, supporting both local file workflows and a more advanced integration with Google Drive.

## **Features**

- **Flexible Document Sourcing**:
  - **Local Mode (Default):** Simply place your PDF and AsciiDoc files in the source_documents/ directory to get started immediately.
  - **Google Drive Mode (Optional):** Provide a Google Drive folder ID to have the pipeline automatically download and sync your source documents.
- **Structured JSON Workflow**: The AI generates a clean, structured JSON file, making the pipeline reliable and eliminating parsing errors.
- **AI-Powered Content & Image Curation**: Leverages Gemini to generate all slide text and to identify relevant diagrams in your source PDFs, creating references to them in the generated JSON.
- **Automated Image Extraction**: A separate utility script reads the generated JSON and automatically extracts the referenced images from your source PDFs.
- **Efficient Caching**:
  - **Google Drive Mode:** Avoids unnecessary downloads by hashing the metadata of your Drive folder.
  - **Both Modes:** Avoids expensive API calls by hashing the state of your local source files, only re-running the AI when content actually changes.
- **Developer Controls**: Includes flags to \--force regeneration, \--force-download from Drive, and run in \--json-only mode for quick content validation.

## **Pipeline Overview**

The project is split into two main stages: Content Generation (managed by run.sh and run_pipeline.py) and Image Extraction (managed by extract_images.py).

**Stage 1: Content Generation (./run.sh)**

## **Setup Guide**

Follow these steps to set up the environment.

### **Step 1: Google Cloud & Drive Setup (One-Time)**

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**: If you don't have one, create a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Note your **Project ID**.
2. **Enable APIs**: In your project, search for and enable the following three APIs:
   - Google Drive API
   - Google Slides API
   - **Vertex AI API**
3. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Navigate to **IAM & Admin \> Service Accounts**.
   - Click **Create Service Account**, give it a name (e.g., slides-generator), and click **Done**.
   - Go to the **IAM** page. Click **Grant Access**, and in the "New principals" field, add the service account's email.
   - Assign it the role of **Vertex AI User**.
   - Back in the **Service Accounts** page, click the **Actions** menu (â‹®) for your new account, select **Manage keys**, and then **Add Key \> Create new key**. Choose **JSON**.
   - A JSON key file will be downloaded. This is your authentication key.
4. **Create a Shared Drive**: In Google Drive, create a new **Shared Drive** (e.g., "Automated Presentations"). This is crucial for the service account to have the correct permissions.
5. **Add Service Account as Member**:
   - Open your downloaded JSON key file and copy the client_email address.
   - Go to your new Shared Drive in Google Drive, click **Manage members**, and paste the service account's email.
   - Assign it the role of **Content manager** and click **Send**.
6. **Prepare Assets in Shared Drive**:
   - Create a folder inside the Shared Drive to store the final presentations (e.g., "Generated Slides"). **Note its ID** from the URL.
   - Place your **Google Slides Template** inside the Shared Drive. **Note its ID** from the URL.

### **Step 2: Local Project Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository** and navigate into the directory.
2. **Run the Install Script**: This creates a Python virtual environment and installs all dependencies from requirements.txt, including PyMuPDF for image extraction.  
   chmod \+x install.sh  
   ./install.sh

3. **Configure .env**: Fill in all the required values in your .env file (Project ID, folder IDs, etc.).
4. **Configure workshops.yaml**: Edit this file to control which workshops you want to generate by setting enabled: true or enabled: false.

## **Usage and Development Workflow**

The pipeline is controlled via the run.sh script, which passes commands to the main run_pipeline.py orchestrator.

### **Local Mode (Default)**

This is the simplest way to use the tool.

1. Place your source .pdf and .adoc files into the source_documents/ directory.
2. Run the pipeline.  
   ./run.sh \--json-only

3. Review the output in json_source/. Once you are happy, run the image extraction and the full pipeline.

### **Google Drive Mode (Optional)**

This mode is ideal for collaborative or remote workflows.

1. Make sure your .env file contains the SOURCE_DOCUMENTS_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID.
2. Run the pipeline. The script will automatically download the files from Google Drive into the source_documents/ directory.  
   ./run.sh \--json-only
